    <h3>Difference between block and inline?</h3>
    <p>
      Ans:A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers
      automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. A
      block-level element always takes up the full width available, stretches
      out to the left and right as far as it can. Two commonly used block
      elements are: p tag and div tag. <br /><br />

      An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only
      takes up as much width as necessary. This is a span tag element inside a
      paragraph.
